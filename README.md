### Hi there 👋 I'm Shelby

I've been developing software professionally since 2015.
Since then I've been lucky to work in a range of domains:

- aerospace 🚀🛰️ (satellite orbits, ground systems networks, launch telemetry)
- build tooling 🏗️📦 (CentOS, rpm, dependency management)
- web services infrastructure 🌐📲 (adtech, ML model deployment, AWS, Chef, Terraform)
- observability 🌈📊 (instrumentation, OpenTelemetry)

#### work 💻🥑

I work as a Developer Advocate at [Honeycomb](http://honeycomb.io/).
My job involves spreading the word about observability,
helping people get the most out of Honeycomb,
and sharing valuable user feedback with our product team.

I'm also responsible for the [Honeycomb blog](http://honeycomb.io/blog/) and [o11ycast](http://o11y.fm/)!

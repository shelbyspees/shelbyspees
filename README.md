### Hi there 👋 I'm Shelby

I've been developing software professionally since 2015.

Since then I've been lucky enough to work in a range of domains:

- aerospace 🚀🛰️ (satellite orbits, ground systems networks, launch telemetry)
- build tooling 🏗️📦 (CentOS, rpm, dependency management)
- web services infrastructure 🌐📲 (adtech, ML model deployment, AWS, Chef, Terraform)
- observability 🌈📊 (instrumentation, OpenTelemetry)

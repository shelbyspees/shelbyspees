#### work 💻🥑

I work as a Developer Advocate at [Honeycomb](http://honeycomb.io/).
My job involves spreading the word about observability,
helping people get the most out of Honeycomb,
and sharing valuable user feedback with our product team.

I'm also responsible for the [Honeycomb blog](http://honeycomb.io/blog/) and [o11ycast](http://o11y.fm/)!
